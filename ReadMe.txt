In this study, the authors used resting-state functional MRI data of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls from two sites (Beijing and Zhumadian Cohort). The authors have provided the data processed in the current study through GitHub (https://github.com/fanfengmei/HLG-ZMD-Schizophrenia-DMN).

We examined the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the 11 seed regions (a sphere with a 6-mm radius) in the DMN (MNI152 standard space with 3 mm isotropic voxels), as derived from a previous study by Andrew-Hanna (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010). All seeds were transformed into surface-based space, including the aMPFC, PCC, dMPFC, temporal parietal junction (TPJ), lateral temporal cortex (LTC), temporal pole (TempP), ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC), posterior inferior parietal lobule (pIPL), retrosplenial cortex (Rsp), parahippocampal cortex (PHC), and hippocampal formation.

For each of the 11 ROIs, we performed a whole-brain seed-based RSFC analysis for each participant in the left and right hemisphere, vertex by vertex. Individual DMN functional connectivity matrices or graphs were then obtained by calculating the spatial pair-wise correlations of the 11 RSFC maps (Z map) to characterize the functional connectivity of the DMN. For each subject, 11*11 DMN matrices were obtained. And information of age, sex, education and head motion info was provided.
